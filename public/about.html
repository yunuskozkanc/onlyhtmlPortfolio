<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My main goal is to be an engineer who is always eager to learn new things, creative and good at finding alternative ways to solve problems. 
  I am confident in teamwork and exchanging ideas with my teammates.Since I work in different sectors, I think I can add a vision to the company I work for in terms of team management and bilateral relations.</p>
